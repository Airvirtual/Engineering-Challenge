# Engineering Challenge - ELC Backend & Elixir Code Test

## Overview

We value practicality and pragmatism in our team, which extends to our approach in evaluating your fit with us. Rather than relying on whiteboard coding sessions, we prefer to discuss code that you have already written during our meeting.

For this engineering challenge, we want you to showcase your skills by completing a project of your own or a substantial pull request on an open-source repository. We understand that many individuals have worked on private or proprietary projects, so this challenge is tailored to accommodate that.

We acknowledge that taking on this assignment requires a commitment of your time, and we greatly appreciate it. Throughout the recruitment process, we will respect your time and strive to work quickly and efficiently. This will be the only technical assessment required, and subsequent conversations will be based on this assessment and your prior experiences.

## Challenge Guidelines

The assignment is designed to be completed within approximately 2 to 3 hours of focused coding. Quality is more important than quantity, so prioritize delivering smaller amounts of high-quality code over large amounts of low-quality code.

Treat this assignment as if you were contributing to an open-source project. Create a repository on GitHub, utilize Git for source control, and use the README file to document your project, providing clear instructions for newcomers to understand what you have built.

We build systems engineered to run in production, so please organize, design, test, deploy, and document your solution as if it were ready for production. We understand that time constraints may limit the scope, so prioritize production-readiness over adding additional features.

In your documentation, think out loud and explain the trade-offs, thoughts behind your choices, and anything you would do differently or improve upon if you had more time or the opportunity to iterate on the project.

Once you are satisfied with your implementation and documentation, you can share your work by either providing a link to your public repository or compressing the project directory. If compressing, give the file a concise name that includes your own name and send it to us.

## What makes a good submission?

In this assignment, you will be tasked with helping our teams manage their food truck habit. Our team members love to eat and enjoy exploring new places to dine, with a particular fondness for food trucks. Fortunately, the city of San Francisco provides open data on food trucks, and we want you to leverage this data to create something interesting for our teams.

The assignment is open-ended, allowing you to choose how you want to utilize the food trucks data. You can create a web API that returns a set of food trucks, develop a web frontend that visualizes nearby food trucks for a given location, build a CLI tool to retrieve the names of all taco trucks in the city, or even construct a system that generates a container with a placeholder webpage featuring the name of each food truck to support their marketing efforts. These ideas are just suggestions, and we encourage you to let your creativity shine. You can find San Francisco's food truck open dataset [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data), and there is an endpoint with a CSV dump of the latest data [here](https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/rqzj-sfat/rows.csv). We have also included a copy of the data in this repository.

Feel free to utilize your Elixir with Phoenix and PostgreSQL skills, and if appropriate, incorporate HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React.

Remember to prioritize production-readiness and ensure thorough documentation for your solution's setup.

Upon completing your implementation and documentation, share your work with us by providing a link to your public repository or by compressing the project directory and sending it to us with a concise file name that includes your name.

We appreciate your time and effort in completing this assessment, and we commit to respecting your time throughout the recruitment process. If you have any questions, please let us know. Thank you for your participation!
